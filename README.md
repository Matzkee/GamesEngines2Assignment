**Description:**
	A scene from Battlestar Gallactica of battle on Helios Delta 6
	
**Story Board:**

**Scene 1:**
* Federation ships prepare themselves to battle.
* There is our planet earth in the background and some of the viper ships flying in formations.
* The large ships are jumping into hyper speed leaving the sector.

**Scene 2:**	
* Federation ships arrive at Helios Delta 6.
* There is another galaxy in the background and some other planets possibly.
* Enemy motherships are further away from the Federation ships.
* Federation ships prepare to battle spawning smaller fighters and slowly progressing towards enemy motherships to ultimately destroy them.
* Meanwhile enemy's smaller fighters are coming in large numbers
* The battle outbreaks.
* From here the process can be autonomous, large federation ships will pick closest enemy mothership to destroy and progress towards it while spawning smaller ships which have been destroyed.
* Enemy motherships also spawn their fighters to a fixed number replacing the ones destroyed.
* The result of the battle ends whichever side big ships are all destroyed.
* Smaller fighters use formations, obstacle avoidance, pursuit and other behaviours to make the battle flow interesting
* Each smaller ship also have attached a special object used for camera to jump from ship to ship giving a different perspective.
